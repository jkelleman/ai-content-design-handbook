Real-world before/after examples showing content improvements across different types.

## Error Messages

### Example 1: Network Error

**❌ Before:**
```
Error 504: Gateway Timeout
The request could not be processed at this time due to a timeout condition.
Please try your request again.
```

**Problems:**
- Technical error code first
- Jargon ("gateway timeout")
- No clear cause
- Vague action

**✅ After:**
```
Connection timeout

Your request took too long to complete. This usually happens when:
• Your internet connection is slow or unstable
• Our servers are experiencing high traffic

What to do:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a minute and try again
3. If the problem continues, contact support

Error code: 504 (for support reference)
```

**Improvements:**
- Plain language title
- Explains what happened
- Lists common causes
- Clear, numbered steps
- Technical code moved to bottom

- Unhelpful

**✅ After:**
```
Workspace name is invalid

Names must:
• Be 3-64 characters long

## Lessons from Leading Companies

These before-and-after pairs come from, or directly apply, the public guidance of large technology companies.

### Example 18: Password requirements (Apple)

```
❌ That password is too short.
✅ Choose a password with at least 8 characters.
```
**Why it works:** Apple's HIG uses this example. It states the requirement instead of the violation, so people know exactly what to do.
([HIG: Writing](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/writing))

### Example 19: Name field validation (Apple)

```
❌ Invalid name.
❌ Don't use numbers or symbols.
✅ Use only letters for your name.
```
**Why it works:** It tells people what to do, not what they did wrong, and appears next to the field.

### Example 20: Loading failure without "we" (Apple)

```
❌ We're having trouble loading this content.
✅ Unable to load content.
```
**Why it works:** Apple notes it's unclear who "we" is. Other companies, such as Atlassian, use "we" deliberately. Either way, add a next step: "Unable to load content. Check your connection and try again."

### Example 21: Value out of range (Microsoft)

```
❌ Bad size.
✅ Enter a size between 1 and 100.
```
**Why it works:** Microsoft's error guidelines say to avoid vague words like "bad" and state the actual criteria.
([Error message guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/error-message-guidelines))

### Example 22: Printer offline (Google)

```
❌ You selected an unavailable printer.
✅ The printer you chose is offline. Choose another printer or check that it's turned on.
```
**Why it works:** Google's technical writing guidance: describe what happened, not what the user did.
([Set the right tone](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/error-messages/set-tone))

### Example 23: A button label (Apple)

```
❌ Let's do it!
✅ Send
```
**Why it works:** Apple's HIG: label buttons with verbs and prioritize clarity over cleverness.

### Example 24: Consistent action names (Shopify)

```
❌ "Upload image" on one page, "Add photos" on another
✅ "Upload image" everywhere
```
**Why it works:** Shopify asks apps to pick one term per action. Synonyms make people wonder whether two buttons do different things.
([App content](https://shopify.dev/apps/design-guidelines/content))

### Example 25: An AI content label (Meta)

```
❌ Made with AI   (on a real photo with one AI-assisted edit)
✅ AI info  →  "Generative AI may have been used to create or edit content in this post."
```
**Why it works:** Meta changed this label after photographers objected that real photos were mislabeled. A label is a claim; word it to match what the system actually knows.
([Report](https://jang.com.pk/en/15206-meta-replaces-made-with-ai-label-with-ai-info-amid-user-criticism-news))

### Example 26: An AI system limitation (Google PAIR)

```
❌ I can't help with that.
✅ I can only search documents in this workspace, and I don't see one about travel policy.
   Try searching the HR site, or ask your manager to add the policy here.
```
**Why it works:** Google's People + AI Guidebook says AI errors should explain what the system can't do and what input would work, and offer a path forward.
([PAIR: Errors + Graceful Failure](https://pair.withgoogle.com/chapter/People%20+%20AI%20Guidebook%20-%20Errors%20+%20Graceful%20Failure.pdf))

### Example 27: An agent receipt

```
❌ Done!
✅ Sent 46 of 48 reminders from dana@acme.com. 2 bounced: billing@oldco.com, ap@northwind.io. Nothing else changed. [View sent]
```
**Why it works:** When AI acts for someone, the confirmation is a receipt: outcome, identity used, failures, and what didn't change. See [Agentic AI Experiences](../templates/ai-content/agentic-experiences.md).

## Key Takeaways

### What Makes Good Content

✅ **Do:**
- Use plain language
- Be specific and concrete
- Provide clear next steps
- Anticipate questions
- Show empathy
- Give examples
- State limitations honestly

❌ **Don't:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Be vague or generic
- Leave users stuck
- Hide information
- Sound robotic
- Assume knowledge
- Overpromise

### Common Patterns

**Error messages:** [What happened] + [Why] + [What to do]

**Success messages:** [Confirmation] + [What's next]

**Empty states:** [Positive frame] + [Explanation] + [Clear action]

**Buttons:** [Specific action verb] + [Object]

**Helper text:** [Context] + [Example]

**Confirmations:** [Specific item] + [What will happen] + [Clear choices]
