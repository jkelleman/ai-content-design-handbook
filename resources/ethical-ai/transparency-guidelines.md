# Transparency Guidelines for AI Content

A framework for honest, clear disclosure about AI use in content experiences.

## Why Transparency Matters

**Users deserve to know when they're interacting with AI.**

**Benefits of transparency:**
- **Builds trust** - Honesty creates credibility
- **Sets expectations** - Users know what AI can/can't do
- **Enables informed consent** - Users choose to engage
- **Legal compliance** - Many regulations require disclosure
- **Reduces harm** - Clear limitations prevent over-reliance

**Costs of opacity:**
- **Erodes trust** - Users feel deceived when they discover AI
- **Increases liability** - Hidden AI use creates legal risk
- **Damages brand** - Perceived as dishonest or manipulative
- **Disappoints users** - Unclear capabilities lead to frustration

## Core Principles

### 1. **Disclose AI Use**

**Users should know they're interacting with AI.**

**When to disclose:**

✅ **Always disclose:**
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- AI-generated content shown to users
- AI making decisions affecting users
- AI collecting or processing user data

⚠️ **Consider disclosing:**
- AI-assisted content (human-written with AI help)
- Behind-the-scenes AI (recommendations, ranking)
- AI in creative processes

❌ **May not need to disclose:**
- Basic automation (not AI)
- Standard algorithms
- Internal tools not affecting users

**Disclosure examples:**

```markdown
Explicit (Recommended):
"I'm an AI assistant powered by [Model Name]"
"This summary was generated by AI"
"AI-assisted content, reviewed by experts"

Visual Indicators:
🤖 AI icon or avatar
"AI" badge on messages
Different visual styling

Contextual:
In settings/about section
In terms of service
In privacy policy
```

---

### 2. **Explain Capabilities & Limitations**

**Users should understand what AI can and can't do.**

**What to explain:**

**Capabilities:**
```markdown
✅ Clear:
"I can help you:
• Answer questions about [specific topic]
• Guide you through [specific process]
• Provide information from [knowledge source]"

❌ Vague:
"I can help with anything!"
```

**Limitations:**
```markdown
✅ Honest:
"I can't:
• Provide medical, legal, or financial advice
• Access your personal data or make changes
• Know information after [training date]
• Understand images or attachments"

❌ Silent:
[Don't mention limitations, hope user doesn't notice]
```

**Accuracy:**
```markdown
✅ Transparent:
"I might make mistakes. Always verify important information."
"I'm powered by AI and may not always be accurate."
"For critical decisions, consult a human expert."

❌ Overconfident:
"I'm always accurate!"
[No mention of potential errors]
```

---

### 3. **Show How AI Works**

**Users should understand the AI's decision-making process.**

**Levels of explanation:**

**Basic (Minimum):**
```markdown
"I'm an AI trained on [type of data] to [purpose]"

Example:
"I'm an AI assistant trained on Fabric documentation 
to help answer questions about the platform."
```

**Intermediate:**
```markdown
"I use [technology] to [process].
I was trained on [data sources] and can [capabilities]."

Example:
"I use natural language processing to understand your questions
and search through Fabric documentation to find relevant answers.
I was trained on our help articles, user guides, and API docs."
```

**Advanced:**
```markdown
Include:
• Model architecture
• Training data sources
• How responses are generated
• Confidence scores
• Why this answer was chosen

Example:
"I found this answer by:
1. Understanding your question about pipeline scheduling
2. Searching documentation (85% relevance match)
3. Summarizing the top 3 results
4. Verifying against our knowledge base

Confidence: High (87%)"
```

**When to provide more detail:**
```markdown
More detail needed when:
- High-stakes decisions
- Unexpected/surprising results
- User questions how it works
- Regulatory requirements
- Building trust in new AI

Less detail needed when:
- Low-stakes interactions
- Well-understood AI use
- User-initiated experience
```

---

### 4. **Provide User Control**

**Users should be able to opt in/out and control their data.**

**Essential controls:**

```markdown
✅ Must provide:
☐ Option to talk to human instead
☐ Way to report issues
☐ Ability to delete conversation history
☐ Control over data usage (opt-in/out of training)
☐ Explanation of how data is used

Consider providing:
☐ Adjust AI behavior (tone, verbosity)
☐ See AI's data sources
☐ Export conversation history
☐ Turn off AI features entirely
```

**Control UI example:**

```markdown
AI Assistant Settings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Enable AI Assistant
[Toggle: ON]
Get AI-powered help and suggestions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Data & Privacy

☐ Allow AI to learn from my interactions
Helps improve AI responses (anonymized)

☐ Store conversation history
Access past conversations (stored 30 days)

☐ Personalize responses
AI adapts to your preferences

### 5. **Admit Uncertainty**

**AI should acknowledge when it doesn't know something.**

**Don't fake confidence:**

```markdown
❌ Bad (Confident but wrong):
User: "What's the maximum file size for uploads?"
AI: "The maximum file size is 500MB."
[Actual limit: 100MB]

✅ Good (Honest about uncertainty):
AI: "I'm not certain of the exact file size limit. 
Let me check the documentation."
[Retrieves accurate info]

Or: "I don't have that specific information. 
Check the documentation or contact support for the exact limit."
```

**Confidence indicators:**

```markdown
High confidence:
"According to the documentation, [fact]."

Medium confidence:
"Based on what I know, [info], but you should verify this."

Low confidence:
"I'm not certain, but you might want to check [source]."

No confidence:
"I don't know. For accurate information, please [alternative]."
```

**When to say "I don't know":**

```markdown
Say "I don't know" when:
- Information not in training data
- Question outside scope
- Confidence below threshold
- Request requires judgment
- Ambiguous or unclear query

Provide:
- Alternative resources
- Human contact option
- How to find answer
- Related information you do know
```

---

### 6. **Source Attribution**

**Show where information comes from.**

**Why it matters:**
- Users can verify
- Builds credibility
- Enables fact-checking
- Shows transparency
- Helps users learn more

**How to attribute:**

```markdown
Inline citations:
"Pipeline runs are limited to 24 hours [documentation link]."

Source panel:
[Response]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Sources:
• Pipeline Documentation
• FAQ: Common Limits
• Release Notes v2.3
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Confidence with source:
"According to the Fabric API guide (docs.fabric.com/api):
[quoted information]"

Multiple sources:
"Based on:
• Official documentation
• Community forum discussions
• Support team guidance
[Response synthesizing these sources]"
```

## Testing Transparency

### User Research Questions

**Test comprehension:**
```markdown
After showing disclosure:

1. "In your own words, what is this?"
   → Do they understand it's AI?

2. "What can this system do?"
   → Do they understand capabilities?

3. "What can't it do?"
   → Do they understand limitations?

4. "How much do you trust this?"
   → Does transparency build trust?

5. "Would you use this?"
   → Does disclosure affect adoption?
```

**Test adequacy:**
```markdown
1. "Do you have enough information to decide?"
   → Is disclosure sufficient?

2. "What else would you want to know?"
   → What's missing?

3. "Is this too much/little information?"
   → Right level of detail?

4. "Where would you look for more details?"
   → Is navigation clear?
```

### A/B Testing Disclosures

**Test different approaches:**

```markdown
Variant A: Explicit upfront
"I'm an AI assistant..."

Variant B: Contextual
AI badge, details on click

Variant C: Progressive
Disclose after first interaction

Measure:
