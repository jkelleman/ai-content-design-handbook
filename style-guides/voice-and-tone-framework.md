# Voice and Tone Framework

A template for defining your product's voice and tone guidelines.

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** = Your product's personality (consistent across all content)
**Tone** = How voice adapts to context (changes based on situation)

Think of it like a person:
- **Voice** = Their core personality traits
- **Tone** = How they adjust their communication style based on the situation

## Defining Your Voice

### Voice Attributes

Choose 3-5 core attributes that define your product's personality:

| Attribute | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| [Attribute 1] | [Definition] | [Example phrase] |
| [Attribute 2] | [Definition] | [Example phrase] |
| [Attribute 3] | [Definition] | [Example phrase] |

**Example:**

| Attribute | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Helpful | We anticipate needs and guide users toward success | "Here's what you can do next" |
| Clear | We use simple language without jargon | "Pipeline failed" not "Execution terminated with non-zero exit code" |
| Confident | We're knowledgeable but not arrogant | "This will create a backup" not "This might maybe create a backup" |

### Voice Principles

**We are:**
- [Principle 1]
- [Principle 2]
- [Principle 3]

**We are NOT:**
- [Anti-principle 1]
- [Anti-principle 2]
- [Anti-principle 3]

**Example:**

**We are:**
- Clear and direct
- Professional but approachable
- Empowering users with knowledge

**We are NOT:**
- Overly technical or jargon-heavy
- Cute or trying too hard to be funny
- Talking down to users

## Tone Guidelines

Tone adapts based on context. Define how your voice shifts across different situations.

### Tone Matrix

| Context | User's Feeling | Our Tone | Example |
|---------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Success | Accomplished | Affirming | "Great! Your pipeline is running." |
| Error | Frustrated | Helpful, calm | "Connection failed. Check your network and try again." |
| Onboarding | Uncertain | Encouraging, clear | "Let's create your first pipeline together." |
| Warning | Concerned | Clear, serious | "This action will permanently delete your data." |
| Empty state | Lost | Motivating, guiding | "Ready to get started? Create your first dataset." |
| Complex task | Overwhelmed | Supportive, step-by-step | "We'll walk through this together." |

### Tone Spectrum

For each context, define where your tone falls on key spectrums:

**Formal ←→ Casual**
```
Most contexts: Slightly casual
Errors: Professional but approachable
Legal/compliance: More formal
```

**Serious ←→ Playful**
```
Most contexts: Friendly but focused
Errors: Serious, never playful
Success states: Can be more upbeat
```

**Direct ←→ Indirect**
```
Errors and warnings: Very direct
Instructions: Direct and clear
Marketing: Can be more narrative
```

**Technical ←→ Plain language**
```
Documentation: Balance both
UI text: Plain language
API docs: More technical acceptable
```

## Language Guidelines

### Words We Use

**Preferred terms:**
- [Term 1] instead of [alternative]
- [Term 2] instead of [alternative]
- [Term 3] instead of [alternative]

**Example:**
- "Select" instead of "click"
- "Error" instead of "failure" or "problem"
- "Sign in" instead of "log in"

### Words We Avoid

❌ **Avoid:**
- Jargon without definition
- Cutesy language ("Oopsie!")
- Diminishing words ("just," "simply," "easy")
- Assumptive language ("obviously," "of course")
- Gendered language ("guys," "he/she")
- Ableist language ("crazy," "blind spot")

### Grammar & Mechanics

**Capitalization:**
- [Your rules]
- Example: Sentence case for buttons, title case for headers

**Punctuation:**
- [Your rules]
- Example: No periods in button labels, periods in complete sentences

**Contractions:**
- [Your policy]
- Example: Use contractions for conversational tone ("you're" not "you are")

**Active vs. Passive voice:**
- [Your preference]
- Example: Use active voice ("System processes your request" not "Your request is processed")

## Voice Examples

### ✅ Good Examples

Show your voice in action across different content types:

**Error message:**
```
✅ "Connection timeout. Check your network settings and try again."

Why it works: Clear, actionable, maintains helpful tone even in error state
```

**Success message:**
```
✅ "Pipeline created! You can monitor its progress in the dashboard."

Why it works: Affirming but not overly excited, points user to next step
```

**Empty state:**
```
✅ "No pipelines yet. Ready to create your first one?"

Why it works: Encouraging without being pushy, clear call to action
```

### ❌ Bad Examples

Show what NOT to do:

**Error message:**
```
❌ "Oops! Something went wrong. 😕"

Why it's bad: Not helpful, no actionable guidance, inappropriate tone for error
```

**Success message:**
```
❌ "OMG! You totally crushed it! 🎉🎉🎉"

Why it's bad: Overly enthusiastic, unprofessional, too casual
```

**Technical content:**
```
❌ "Utilize the pipeline orchestration service to facilitate data ingestion workflows"

Why it's bad: Unnecessarily complex language, jargon-heavy
```

## Context-Specific Guidelines

### Error Messages

**Tone:** Calm, helpful, clear
**Structure:** [What happened] + [Why/Context] + [What to do]
**Example:** "Pipeline failed. Network connection lost. Check your connection and try again."

### Success Messages

**Tone:** Affirming, forward-looking
**Structure:** [Confirm action] + [Next step optional]
**Example:** "Dataset created successfully. Add data to get started."

### Onboarding

**Tone:** Encouraging, clear, patient
**Structure:** [Welcome/Context] + [Simple explanation] + [Clear next step]
**Example:** "Welcome to Fabric! Let's create your first pipeline. It takes about 2 minutes."

### Documentation

**Tone:** Clear, authoritative, helpful
**Structure:** [Concept] + [Step-by-step] + [Example]
**Example:** "Pipelines automate data workflows. To create one: 1. Select Create Pipeline 2. Configure settings 3. Add activities"

### Marketing/Landing Pages

**Tone:** [Your preference]
**Structure:** [Your pattern]
**Example:** [Your example]

### Legal/Compliance

**Tone:** Clear, professional, accurate
**Structure:** [Requirement] + [User action needed]
**Example:** "Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit. By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service."

## AI-Specific Voice Guidelines

If your product includes AI features, define how voice applies to AI interactions:

### AI Transparency

**Always disclose AI:**
```
✅ "I'm an AI assistant trained to help with [product]."
```

**Admit uncertainty:**
```
✅ "I'm not certain about that. Let me connect you with a human expert."
```

**Never fake human:**
```
❌ "Hi, I'm Sarah from support!"
[When it's actually AI]
```

### AI Tone

**Helpful but humble:**
- Acknowledge AI limitations
- Don't overpromise capabilities
- Offer human alternatives

**Example:**
```
✅ "I can help with common questions about pipelines, but complex issues 
may need human support. What can I help with?"
```
