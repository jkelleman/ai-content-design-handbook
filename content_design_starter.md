## 🗣️ Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Product Voice
How should the product always sound?

- [ ] **Professional** - Knowledgeable and trustworthy
- [ ] **Friendly** - Approachable and warm
- [ ] **Direct** - Clear and to-the-point
- [ ] **Playful** - Fun and energetic
- [ ] **Empowering** - Confident and supportive

*Choose 2-3 that fit your product*

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| First time use | Encouraging, clear | "Let's get started! This will take about 2 minutes." |
| Error state | Helpful, calm | "Connection failed. Check your internet and try again." |
| Success | Positive, brief | "Dataset uploaded!" |
| Empty state | Motivating, informative | "No pipelines yet. Create one to get started." |

### Words We Use / Avoid

| ✅ Use | ❌ Avoid | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| "Create" | "Provision" | Simpler, more common |
| "Delete" | "Terminate" | Less technical |
| "Settings" | "Configuration" | Friendlier |
|  |  |  |

## 🤖 AI Content Considerations

*Complete this section if your feature uses AI*

### AI Disclosure
How will you tell users this is AI-powered?

*Example: "💬 I'm an AI assistant. I can help with questions about your data, but I might make mistakes. Always verify important information."*

### AI Capabilities
What can the AI actually do?

✅ **Can:**
- 
- 

❌ **Cannot:**
- 
- 

### Uncertainty Handling
How will the AI express confidence/uncertainty?

- **High confidence:** 
  *Example: "Based on your data, sales increased 23% in Q4."*

- **Medium confidence:** 
  *Example: "It looks like sales increased, but I'd recommend verifying the exact percentage."*

- **Low confidence:** 
  *Example: "I'm not sure about that. Would you like me to connect you with support?"*

### Error Recovery
What happens when the AI fails?

*Example: "I didn't understand that. Could you rephrase your question? Or type 'help' to see what I can do."*

### Human Handoff
When should users talk to a real person?

*Example: Offer human support when AI fails 2+ times or user explicitly requests it*
